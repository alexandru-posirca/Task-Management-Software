## üìù General Info

* This web platform is my dissertation work within the computer science master's degree completed this year.
* The topic of the dissertation is "Platforms and tools for managing and developing the performance of agile projects for software applications".
* The web platform is developed in-house under the name Task Vision, where as a source of inspiration for the interface of the created software, we used the Kanban Board from the Jira platform developed by Atlassian.
* I made my own version of the Kanban web platform for Agile project management, fully dynamic, which was developed in a web interface that follows modern standards for UI/UX design, using high-performance markup implementation technologies.
* The Task Vision platform was implemented on the basis of modern, high-performance technologies, which allow a lot of flexibility in development and at the same time obtaining results related to the site's performance at a very high level in terms of the site's indexing in engines search engines.
* The content, functionalities and design of the web interface were custom developed, without the use of other external libraries, predefined themes in a CMS or preconfigured templates in a public software.
